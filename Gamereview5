Summary
The game as far as I could tell has an implied story about the main character and her goal. You control edna and you solve puzzles and make your way through the game by possesing statuaues in your line of sight. 

Final Thoughts
I like the game its fun little game you can play kind of mindlessly. I have no issues exept that I would like more story personally. There seems to be an implied story from each level cards telling me that the character has a prupose for doing this but it doesnt say what.
